[![Rust Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust_Community%20-Join_us-brightgreen?style=plastic&logo=rust)](https://www.rust-lang.org/community)

"the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and exit.". 

_The description above and the code was taken from: [Official Rust Programming Language Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html_)_
